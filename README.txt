SPACE GUY - PYTHON PROTOTYPE
Andrew Gaal

Space Guy is an arcade-style shoot-em-up in the tradition of games like Galaga and Platypus. This version of the game is
essentially a working prototype. While the gameplay is relatively rudimentary, all of the basic components of a more complete
version are present.

This game was written as part of a college course, with the goal of teaching myself Python.
The reports I created to show my progress over the course of the semester can be found in the "Project Documentation" folder.
I have also included a compiled version of the game - "Space_Guy.zip". This was created using the PyInstaller utility to
compile the game as a standalone executable. Note: Most firewalls flag "Space Guy.exe" as a threat for some reason, so you
may need to add it as an exception in order to play the game.
